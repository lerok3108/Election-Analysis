# Election-Analysis
Analysis of the election results with Python
##Overview of Election Audit. 
The purpose of this project was to complete the audit of the local election and present the results in the easy-to-read format. The results of the elections were provided as comma-separated-values file (election_results.csv) and were analyzed using Python version 3.7.6 and Visual Studio Code. The results were recorded in a .txt file. 
##Election-Audit Results
* The total number of votes cast in this election was 369,711
* The candidates were
     * Charles Casper Stockham
     * Diana DeGette
     * Raymon Anthony Doane
* The results for each candidate were as follows:
      * Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
      * Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
      * Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
* The winner of the election was Diana DeGette with 73.8% (85,213) votes cast for this candidate

##Election-Audit Summary
If provided a different data set, the code can be modified to be used in the future elections. First, the new path will need to be set up for the date set to be read and analyzed by Python. The total votes and winners can be calculated using the same code, the list of counties can be expanded and can potentially be used to fit state elections. By adding if-statements, it can be determined which candidate was more popular in which county or state.
